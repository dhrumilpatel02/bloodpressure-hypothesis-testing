# bloodpressure-hypothesis-testing

# Objective

The dataset provided here is the Blood Pressure data from before and after exercising of patients. We are trying to determine if an individual’s blood pressure has changed after exercising regularly for the past month (30-days) or not.

# Hypothesis Statement

As the values of Mean of Before (µ) = 138.28 and Mean of After (µo) = 130.28 are unequal, this is known as Alternative Hypothesis.
Therefore, Ha: µ ≠ µo

# Step by step Analysis

First, we calculate the Mean and Standard Deviation of Before and After. As the Hypothesis statement states that µ ≠ µo. Now we take the p-value approach, for that we need to calculate z score and then find the p-value to perform analysis. As the p-value is 5.046714e-07 which is much lower than the significance interval of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.

# Summary of findings and conclusion

The findings that we have after the analysis depict that as the mean is not equal, this also affects the z score, as well as the p-value which as a result affects the hypothesis on a whole, this can be a different scenario if the mean is equal. To conclude, this eventually proves we reject the null hypothesis.
